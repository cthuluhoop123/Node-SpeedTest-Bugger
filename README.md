Node SpeedTest Bugger
This is just a simple project that runs a speedtest hourly and tweets your service provider (you'll have to define that in theh code) if the speed is below a threshold (you have to set theh threshold. Default is 10Mbps).

You'll have to get your own Twitter API Key from https://dev.twitter.com/apps
