# Node-SpeedTest-Bugger
Node SpeedTest Bugger
This is just a simple project that runs a speedtest hourly and tweets your service provider (you'll have to define that in theh code) if the speed is below a threshold (you have to set theh threshold. Default is 10Mbps).
It plots all data onto https://www.plot.ly

You'll have to get an API Key from plot.ly and also twitter.
